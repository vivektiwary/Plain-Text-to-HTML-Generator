#Plain Text to HTML Converter

This is a pure python converter, it does not require any external library, the only requirement is Python 2.7 or higher.
This program can be run from terminal or any IDE by providing '3' command line arguments.
1. The name of the input file
2. The name of the output file
3. The type of code you have used in the document(for ex: js)
One thing you have to keep in mind is the number of lines has to be added manually.
I will make this configurable in my next iteration.
The format of the input file should be:
1. If you want some line to be a 'heading' end it with ':'
2. If you want some line to be a list, start it with a number and a '.'(dot)
3. If you want to have some color coding for a particular word, enclose that word in quote("") marks
